Description
===========

This program inverts a matrix using Gauss-Jordan elimination. The input matrix
is generated by the program based on the dimension given as a command-line
argument.

Usage
=====

The command line is:

    MatrixInvert dim

where the argument dim is the dimension of the matrix.

Remember to set the stack size to a sufficiently large value, such as
export QT_STACK_SIZE=200000


Example:
MatrixInvert 1000
