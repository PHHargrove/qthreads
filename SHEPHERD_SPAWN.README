Shepherd spawns create one qthread per worker on the desired shepherd. See
"shepherd_spawn" in qthread.c. Kokkos likely wants a way to ensure that there
are never two shepherd tasks in progress at the same time (to prevent deadlock
on internal barriers in the code), but I wasn't able to get that working
correctly. I've added the shepherd_spawn test in test/basics as a VERY simple
test.
